As I've mentioned in my post about [Pulumi]({% post_url 2020-04-21-pulumi %}), I don't like `helm template` approach.
In my opinion, it's better to stick with the tool rather that mimic it's behaviour. In case of helm "sticking with the tool"
also means out of the box support for the standard `helm` tool, including plugins.

My tool of choice is [Helmsman](https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman)

<!--more-->

I appreciate the fact that building abstraction on top of the tool such as helm is not ideal. That's why there are no
major players in this field.

And there are even less of these which were not abandoned by their authors, and support changes introduced in helm 3. 

## Alternatives

- [Pulumi](http://pulumi.com/) - didn't like it for use of `helm template`.
- [Ship](https://www.replicated.com/ship/) - concentrated on a single application lifecycle.
- [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) - quite popular, but I didn't like the fact that the configuration file
    (`helmfile.yaml`) was treated as a Go template file.
- [Landscaper](https://github.com/Eneco/landscaper) - deprecated in favour of `helmfile` just couple days ago.
- [Reckoner](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/reckoner) - Python-based, quite slow in my experience,
    very [brief](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/reckoner/tree/master/docs) documentation, lack of secrets or environment
    variables management.
    
## Installation (on macOS)

{% raw %}
```bash
brew install helm helmsman sops
helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff --version master
helm plugin install https://github.com/fabmation-gmbh/helm-whatup
helm plugin install https://github.com/futuresimple/helm-secrets
```
{% endraw %}

## Usage

- Create [Desired State Specification](https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman/blob/master/docs/desired_state_specification.md)
    file (`helmsman.yaml` in this example)
- `helmsman --apply -p 3 -f helmsman.yaml`, where `-p` is parallelism level. I set it to `1` on my Raspberry PI k3s cluster,
    otherwise it can't cope with the load; my intel-based cluster works better, and `-p 3` speeds things up.
- ...
- Profit!

## Secrets Management
Use [helm-secrets](https://github.com/zendesk/helm-secrets) and [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) (installed in
my example) for secret management.
 
With GPG key [it's as easy as](https://github.com/mozilla/sops#test-with-the-dev-pgp-key):

{% raw %}
```bash
export SOPS_PGP_FP="<KEY_ID>"
sops /path/to/new/or/existing/secrets-file.yaml
```
{% endraw %}

- Each value is encoded separately, which makes it perfect for GitOps and change management.
- Cloud KMS services are supported.

## Extracting common variables into dotenv

`.env` files are supported, and they are ideal for reusable values like URLs, hostnames, IP addresses, versions.

`ohmyzsh` has even a [dotenv plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/dotenv) to load them up
automatically into your shell.

Simple `.env` looks like:

{% raw %}
```bash
IP_ETCD=192.168.0.100
# Some comment
VERSION_KIBANA=7.6.2
```
{% endraw %}


## Desired State Definition (DSD) tips

Both environment variables can secrets can then be referenced in the
[Desired State Specification](https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman/blob/master/docs/desired_state_specification.md) file.

You can (and should) also extract value files for individual charts into separate files.

I use the following folder structure:

{% raw %}
```
.
├── charts
│   ├── kibana
│   └── prometheus-operator
├── helmsman.yaml
├── secrets
│   ├── kibana.yaml
│   └── prometheus-operator.yaml
└── values
    ├── kibana-default.yaml
    ├── kibana.yaml
    ├── prometheus-operator-default.yaml
    └── prometheus-operator.yaml
``` 
{% endraw %}

- `charts/` hold unpacked chart archives (`.gitignore`'d) - I use it for updating to latest versions, more on that later.
- `secrets/` hold files with sensitive information, encrypted by `sops`
- `values/` hold value files used to configure charts, as well as default value files extracted from `charts/`. Default
    value files are stored in git, that's how I find out what changed between currently installed and latest chart release.
    Then I upgrade values used by installed apps accordingly. 

Helmsman DSD file looks like this:

{% raw %}
```yaml
settings:
  # I use that to control chart removal order - use it rarely :)
  reverseDelete: true

# Namespaces observed by helmsman. It will remove any charts from these namespaces that are not managed by helmsman.
namespaces:
  kibana: {}
  prometheus-operator: {}

# All your helm repos go here
helmRepos:
  stable: 'https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com'

apps:
  # That's pretty self-descriptive IMHO :)
  kibana:
    namespace: kibana
    chart: stable/kibana
    version: 3.2.6 # Chart version
    enabled: true # Set to false, and release will be removed
    secretsFile: secrets/kibana.yaml # Path to yaml file with secrets managed by sops. It will be decrypted, and later used as a regular values file (helm -f)
    valuesFile: values/kibana.yaml # Yaml file with unencrypted configuration values  (helm -f)
    set:
      image.tag: '${VERSION_KIBANA}' # Here you can use variables defined in .env (helm --set key=value)
      'ingress.hosts[0]': '${DNS_NAME_KIBANA}' # And even address array indices

  prometheus-operator:
    namespace: prometheus-operator
    chart: stable/prometheus-operator
    version: 8.13.0
    enabled: true
    valuesFiles: # You can use multiple values files if necessary
      - values/prometheus-operator.yaml
      - values/prometheus-operator-rules.yaml
    secretsFile: secrets/prometheus-operator.yaml
    priority: -50 # And also set priority. The lower, the sooner it will be executed when installing. And the later during deletion (due to reverseDelete)
    wait: true # You can also wait...
    timeout: 600 #... for a specific timeout until chart is fully deployed
    noHooks: true # You can disable Helm hooks 
    helmFlags: ['--skip-crds'] # Or pass additional flags to helm command line, if necessary
```
{% endraw %}

## Upgrading charts

I use [helm-whatup](https://github.com/fabmation-gmbh/helm-whatup) plugin to find updates for the charts:

```shell script
helm whatup --all-namespaces -a
```

And I wrote a script that supplements the helmsman upgrade process:
- Run `helm whatup`
- For each outdated chart run `helm fetch <chart_name> --version=<chart_new_version> --untar --destination charts/`
- Then I copy `charts/<chart_name>/values.yaml` to `values/<chart_name>-default.yaml`

I am too ashamed of the script to share it though :smile:.

Once updated charts are fetched, I update chart versions in `helmsman.yaml`, make necessary updates to my overridden values,
and run `helmsman apply...` again.
